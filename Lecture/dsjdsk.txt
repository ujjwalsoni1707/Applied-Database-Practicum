5. Give an example of a relation R that is a total injective function from a set A to itself but is not a bijcction. 

6. Let f: A B and g: B C be function. (a) Prove that if the composition gofisa bijection. then f is a total injection and g is a surjection. (b) Show there is a total injection / and a bijection, g, such that g of is not a bijection. 

7. Let X(a,b). If F: X surjective functions F X, then list all partial functions F, all functions F, all injective functions F, and all
